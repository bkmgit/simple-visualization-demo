The [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) program here solves the two dimensional Klein Gordon 
equation with periodic boundary conditions using a second order 
[finite difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference) scheme in both space and time. Images showing variations 
in the resulting numerically computed field are generated automatically and saved to disk during the computation. The images 
use a modified [portable graymap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#File_formats) format, that is compressed using the 
ranged [Asymmetric Numeral System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_numeral_systems) based on the Java implementation 
available [here](https://github.com/Martsim/crypto_seminar_2017_fall)
