The [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) program here solves the two dimensional Klein Gordon 
equation with periodic boundary conditions using a second order 
[finite difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference) scheme in both space and time. Images showing variations 
in the resulting numerically computed field are generated automatically and saved to disk during the computation. The images 
are uncompressed and use the [portable graymap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#File_formats) format.
